- 👋 Hi, I’m @noolldave
- 👀 I’m interested in python
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the Pimcore Ecosystem...
   -  🙄 I’m struggling with the video pimcore tutorials.

         it would help having:
      
            ... native speakers or
            ... the tutorials should be offered in other languages or
            ... offer the transcripts

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any python project
- ✉️ you can find me at @gmail.com ;)
